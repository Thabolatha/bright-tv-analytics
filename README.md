# bright-tv-analytics
This project focuses on analysing viewer behaviour using two integrated datasets: user profiles and viewership logs. The purpose of the analysis was to understand how different demographics consume television content, determine peak viewing hours, and identify strong-performing channels.

The merged dataset provided visibility into age, gender, location, channels watched, viewing duration, and timestamps — enabling a full demographic and behavioural analysis.
